Cat Clicker Game
============================

### Start the game
1. Go to the Settings tab in my knockout.cat-clicker repository.
2. Scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, and open the link in your preferred browser.

### How to Play
Select a cat name at the top of the list, and click the cat's picture for more cats.
You can toggle between cat names, and the total for each cat is saved.

### What I Learned
This project was part of my advanced Udacity coursework. The coursework involved an evolving scope, so I was forced to rethink how my code worked, and change it to address evolving objectives/functionality.
This project taught me the basics of Knockout JS.
